Initial location for NeuronDotNet source code used was 
  /workspace/base/shelldev/lib/externalextended/NeuronDotNetGPL/

This was essentially the same code as in the upstream Git repository,
except some small changes in the solution file, project file, and Helper.cs,
which should not have any influence on use in IGLib. Therefore, these changes
were not taken over, except maybe for project file.

Also, documentation is added inside 00IGLib/ directory beside that.

P.S. - CORRECTION:

In fact, no changes will be added here. Instead, a new branch will be 
created from this one, with suffix _Modified.
